### About me 

I'm new to the coding scene, currently studying [JAMStack with the Coders Guild](https://thecodersguild.org.uk/blog/learn-web-and-app-development-with-the-jamstack/). My only previous coding experience is self taught in my role as a website content editor, mainly working through the html using the CMS to clear dodgy formatting carried over by contributors who copied and pasted directly from Word rather than using a text editor!

I studied French and Italian at university, and also have a good working knowledge (enough to order a beer at least!) of German. I'm hoping these skills will help me learn these new coding languages.

We have a 20 month old daughter, Charlotte. After nearly two years out of work to be her primary carer, I am looking for opportunities to return to adult world and not have to listen to Hey Duggee all day!

I love being a mum, but slightly worried that my daughter has learned to say 'stab' before 'mummy'.

### Interests

- Football (As a Blackburn Rovers fan my happy place is most certainly **NOT** Turf Moor) <img align="right" width="200" height="200" alt="Caroline and her daughter both smiling and wearing Blackburn Rovers shirts" src="https://i.imgur.com/Dbs7PzUm.jpg">
- Languages - French, German, Italian and am currently learning some Makaton and BSL to help my daughter with her communication skills.
- Baking
- Girlguiding - I've been a Brownnie Leader for 7 years and am currently organising and leading meetings for our unit via Zoom.
